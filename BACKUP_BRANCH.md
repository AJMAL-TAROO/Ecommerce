## Branch Status
A local branch `backup-main-01` has been created that points to the exact commit of main (e5e4aa9).

### To push this backup branch to remote:
Due to authentication constraints in the current environment, the branch needs to be pushed manually with proper credentials:

```bash
# If you have push access, run:
git push origin backup-main-01:backup-main-01

# Or via GitHub API:
# Create a ref pointing to commit e5e4aa9351dfb86573db78b0069a44dde9b0771f
# with ref name: refs/heads/backup-main-01
```

## Restoring from Backup
To restore the main branch to this exact state:
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard e5e4aa9351dfb86573db78b0069a44dde9b0771f
# Or if backup-main-01 is pushed:
git reset --hard backup-main-01
```

## Verifying the Backup
The backup branch can be verified with:
```bash
git log backup-main-01 --oneline -1
# Should show: e5e4aa9 Merge pull request #33 from AJMAL-TAROO/revert-32-copilot/fix-order-details-view-error
```
