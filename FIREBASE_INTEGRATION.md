## Firebase Database Structure

```
{
  "products": {
    "productId": {
      "name": "Product Name",
      "category": "Category",
      "price": 99.99,
      "description": "Description",
      "image": "url",
      "inStock": true,
      "createdAt": timestamp,
      "updatedAt": timestamp
    }
  },
  "categories": ["All", "Electronics", "Accessories", "Sports", "Home"],
  "orders": {
    "orderId": {
      "orderId": "orderId",
      "customerName": "Name",
      "customerPhone": "Phone",
      "customerAddress": "Address",
      "items": [...],
      "totalAmount": 199.99,
      "paymentScreenshot": "firebase-storage-url",
      "status": "pending",
      "createdAt": timestamp
    }
  },
  "admin": {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123",
    "email": "admin@beverlyshop.com",
    "createdAt": timestamp
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### Products Management
- Products are stored in Firebase Realtime Database
- Product images can be:
  - External URLs (e.g., Unsplash)
  - Uploaded files stored in Firebase Storage at `products/`
- Automatic data migration from embedded data on first run

### Order Management
- Customer orders stored with complete details
- Payment screenshots uploaded to Firebase Storage at `payments/`
- Order status tracking (pending, completed, etc.)
- Timestamp tracking for all orders

### Admin Authentication
- Secure admin access with username/password
- Default credentials: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- Admin data stored in Firebase Realtime Database
- Note: In production, passwords should be properly hashed

### Image Storage
- Product images: `products/{timestamp}_{filename}`
- Payment screenshots: `payments/{timestamp}_{filename}`
- Automatic cleanup when products are deleted

### Offline Fallback
- Application works offline with embedded data
- Graceful degradation when Firebase is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing Results

✅ Application loads successfully
✅ Products display correctly with embedded data fallback
✅ Shopping cart functionality works
✅ Add to cart notifications appear
✅ Admin login modal displays correctly
✅ All UI components render properly

## Default Admin Credentials

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123

**Important**: Change these credentials in Firebase Console for production use.

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Security**:
   - Implement proper password hashing
   - Set up Firebase Security Rules
   - Enable Firebase Authentication for users
   
2. **Features**:
   - Add email notifications for orders
   - Implement order status tracking
   - Add product search with Firebase queries
   - Enable user reviews and ratings

3. **Performance**:
   - Implement data caching
   - Optimize image loading
   - Add pagination for large datasets

## Notes

- Firebase configuration is exposed in client-side code (normal for web apps)
- Security is managed through Firebase Security Rules
- The application auto-migrates existing data to Firebase on first run
- All timestamps use Firebase ServerValue.TIMESTAMP for consistency
