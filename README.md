## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A local web server (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AJMAL-TAROO/Ecommerce.git
cd Ecommerce
```

# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (http-server)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

Alternatively, you can simply open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Mock Data Structure

The `products.json` file simulates a Firebase Realtime Database structure:

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Product Name",
      "category": "Category",
      "price": 99.99,
      "description": "Product description",
      "image": "image-url",
      "inStock": true,
      "rating": 4.5,
      "reviews": 100
    }
  ],
  "categories": ["All", "Electronics", "Accessories", "Sports", "Home"]
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Products
Edit the `data/products.json` file and add new product objects following the existing structure.

### Changing Themes
DaisyUI supports multiple themes. Change the `data-theme` attribute in the `<html>` tag:
```html
<html lang="en" data-theme="dark">
```

Available themes: light, dark, cupcake, bumblebee, emerald, corporate, synthwave, retro, cyberpunk, valentine, halloween, garden, forest, aqua, lofi, pastel, fantasy, wireframe, black, luxury, dracula, cmyk, autumn, business, acid, lemonade, night, coffee, winter

### Modifying Styles
- Custom CSS is included in the `<style>` tag in `index.html`
- TailwindCSS classes can be modified directly in the HTML
- DaisyUI component classes provide pre-built components
